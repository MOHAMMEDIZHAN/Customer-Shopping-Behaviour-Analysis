# 👨🏻‍💻 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories. The objective was to uncover actionable insights related to customer demographics, spending patterns, product performance, discounts, subscriptions, and loyalty behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

The workflow began with data cleaning and preprocessing in Python, including handling missing values, standardizing column names, and performing feature engineering such as age group classification and purchase frequency derivation. The cleaned data was then integrated into a PostgreSQL database, enabling structured SQL-based business analysis.

Using SQL, multiple business-focused queries were executed to analyze revenue distribution, high-spending discount users, top-rated and top-selling products, shipping behavior, subscription impact, repeat buyers, and customer segmentation (New, Returning, Loyal). Finally, insights were visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard, providing a comprehensive view of customer behavior and revenue trends.

The project concludes with business recommendations aimed at improving subscriptions, customer retention, discount strategies, and targeted marketing.
